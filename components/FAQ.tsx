      question: "How long does it take to implement an AI solution?",
      answer:
        "Implementation timelines vary based on complexity and your existing infrastructure. Most solutions launch within 2-3 weeks from discovery to deployment. We break the process into phases so you can see results early while we build out more sophisticated capabilities.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you integrate with our existing systems?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. We specialize in seamless integration with your current tech stack—CRMs, databases, APIs, and custom applications. Our solutions are built to complement and enhance what you already have, not replace it entirely.",
    },
    {
      question: "What level of support do we get after launch?",
      answer:
        "We provide ongoing support through dedicated channels, monthly performance reviews, and continuous optimization. Your AI system learns and improves over time, and we're here to adjust, refine, and expand capabilities as your business evolves.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure data security and privacy?",
      answer:
        "Data security is non-negotiable. We implement enterprise-grade encryption, follow industry compliance standards (GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2), and maintain strict access controls. Your data remains in your infrastructure or certified cloud providers you trust.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can we customize the AI behavior for our specific workflows?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Every solution is custom-built for your unique workflows and business logic. We don't use generic templates—we analyze your specific needs and train the AI system to operate exactly how your team needs it to work.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the pricing model?",
      answer:
        "We offer flexible pricing based on complexity, scale, and the specific services you need. We typically discuss this during discovery to understand your requirements, budget, and expected ROI. No hidden costs—just transparent pricing.",
    },
